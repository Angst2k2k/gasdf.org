<p>Georgia State Defense Force (GSDF) Chaplain Candidate (CC) (2nd Lt.) Warren Wood was recently commissioned into the Georgia Army National Guard (GAARNG), following his acceptance into the <a href="https://m.goarmy.com/chaplain/become-an-army-chaplain/candidate-program.m.html">U. S. Army Chaplain Candidate Program.</a></p>
<p>The commission and program acceptance were significant career achievements for CC (2nd Lt) Wood. Yet, this pursuit began well before he started the program application process several months ago.</p>
<p>“My desire is to serve others in uniform as a military Chaplain,” CC (2nd Lt.) Wood said. “It has been a lifelong dream.”</p>

<p>GARRNG Chaplain (CH) (Lt. Col.) Kevin Peek of the State Chaplain Office, Joint Force Headquarters, delivered the oath to CC (2nd Lt.)

GAARNG Chaplains and Chaplain Candidates joined GSDF Soldiers in attending the ceremony.</p>

<p>"One of our mission tasks is to support the Georgia National Guard. That includes sending them our very best Chaplains o grow and strengthen their organization," GSDF Deputy Command Chaplain CH (1st Lt). Jack Nieves said. "The heart of every Chaplain is to serve and provide emotional support to the Soldiers in their ranks. CC (2LT) Wood personifies that exact same spirit."</p>
<p>GSDF 5th Brigade Soldiers Command Sgt. Maj. Robert Bayne and Warrant Officer 3 Howard Seay also attended. CC Wood had served in the Office of the Chaplain for the GSDF 5th Brigade.</p>

<div dir="auto">“We are grateful for CC (2nd Lt.) Wood’s service to the GSDF and to the 5th Brigade,” said Warrant Officer 3 Seay, who accepted the honor of placing the U.S. Army branch tape on CC (2nd Lt.) Wood’s uniform as part of the ceremonial duties. “We wish him all the very best in his new journey."</div>

<p>“I want to say, ‘thank you,’ to the GSDF for giving me my first opportunity to serve the state of Georgia, and for giving me the tools that have empowered me to take this next step with an elevated altitude for success,” he said. “I am grateful for the GSDF's unwavering support.”</p>

<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><strong>Q</strong><strong>.</strong> Are you prior service?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><strong>A</strong><strong>. </strong>No prior service. My father was a career Soldier in the U.S. Army. As I child, I traveled from post to post with my family.<br />
<strong><br />
Q</strong>. As a Chaplain Candidate, what duties have you performed?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><strong>A</strong>. I have provided crisis intervention as a certified instructional trainer instructor, as well as      protestant services (communion, devotion, prayer, etc.). I also have provided a ministerial               presence both GSDF and NG counterparts.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>. What brought you to this pursuit?</p>
<p><strong>A. </strong>I felt God was leading me to take the next step in serving this wonderful state and our country, when called upon.</p>
