<p>Georgia State Defense Force (GSDF) Chaplain Candidate (CC) (2nd Lt.) Warren Wood was recently commissioned into the Georgia Army National Guard (GAARNG), following his acceptance into the <a href="https://m.goarmy.com/chaplain/become-an-army-chaplain/candidate-program.m.html">U. S. Army Chaplain Candidate Program.</a></p>
<p>The commission and program acceptance were significant career achievements for CC (2nd Lt) Wood. Yet, this pursuit began well before he started the program application process several months ago.</p>
<p>“My desire is to serve others in uniform as a military Chaplain,” CC (2nd Lt.) Wood said. “It has been a lifelong dream.”</p>

<p>"One of our mission tasks is to support the Georgia National Guard. That includes sending them our very best Chaplains o grow and strengthen their organization," GSDF Deputy Command Chaplain CH (1st Lt). Jack Nieves said. "The heart of every Chaplain is to serve and provide emotional support to the Soldiers in their ranks. CC (2LT) Wood personifies that exact same spirit."</p>
<p>GSDF 5th Brigade Soldiers Command Sgt. Maj. Robert Bayne and Warrant Officer 3 Howard Seay also attended. CC Wood had served in the Office of the Chaplain for the GSDF 5th Brigade.</p>
