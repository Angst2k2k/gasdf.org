    TRAINING CENTER, Ft. Stewart, Ga. 28 Feb 2015 – The Andrew Sullens Marksmanship
    Competition began its rain soaked Ft. Stewart, Ga. range 2nd year with a series
    of first. The competition, serving as a precursor to the W.P. Wilson Marksmanship
    Competition and hosted by the National Guard Bureau, honors it’s namesake who
    is a Purple Heart recipient of the Iraq War and encourages camaraderie and expert
    weaponry. “We are looking to go beyond the basic ’40-rounds’ mentality and motivate
    our Warrior Guardsman to succeed as professional marksmen,” said match originator
    Sgt. 1st Class Jakob J. Raven.  The four-person team line-up is comprised of approximately
    43 participants and will award the newly authorized Georgia Governor’s-20 tab
    recognizing the best of the best. A diverse make-up of participants also pepper
    the range landscape for 2015 as the Sullens’ Competition hosts it’s first female
    team member as well as two Georgia Air National Guard teams.“It is important to
    remember that we are all marksmen primary to our military jobs,” Raven said. (Georgia
