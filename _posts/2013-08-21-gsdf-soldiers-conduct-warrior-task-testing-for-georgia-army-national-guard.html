<p>The training group from the Georgia State Defense Force, led by CPT Donald Lankford, were originally tasked as evaluators. However, once the proficiency of the GSDF soldiers became apparent they were utilized as instructors as well. Over the course of the week's training, all of the goals assigned by the 1177th Transportation Company’s leadership were flawlessly completed.</p>

<p>Soldiers from both the National Guard and GSDF marched away not only with expanded warrior knowledge, but a better understanding of each others capabilities. In addition, a solid foundation was formed on which to further solidify the relationship between the Georgia Army National Guard and the Georgia State Defense Force.</p>
