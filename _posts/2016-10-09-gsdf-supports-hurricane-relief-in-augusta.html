After working with shelter managers to assess needs, GSDF teams were dispatched to provide emergency assistance. Maj. John W. Morgan, officer in charge during the mission, reported that approximately 2,900 evacuees were temporarily housed in the 10 shelters supported by the GSDF.</p>

<p>As soldiers from 1st Brigade began to arrive, GSDF members were sent to provide support at shelters with the highest number of evacuees. Teams were sent to the remaining shelters when additional Soldiers from 76th Support Brigade and TRADOC became available. GSDF Soldiers provided area security, crowd control, and chaplain services. In addition, GSDF members assisted Red Cross volunteers in setting up cots for evacuees and distributing supplies.</p>
