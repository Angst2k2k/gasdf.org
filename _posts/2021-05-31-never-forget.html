<p>Commander, 2nd Battalion/1st Brigade, Georgia State Defense Force</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's Memorial Day weekend.</p>
<p>Some of us will take some much-deserved time off. Others will finally get a chance to see family and friends... in person... It's all good.</p>
<p>But for the Georgia State Defense Force 2nd battalion/1st brigade (2/1), we'll lace up our boots, square away our uniforms, and head to the Georgia National Cemetery in Canton. It's holy ground, and it's an honor to serve.</p>

<p>The Silent Tribute is a mission the 2/1 has done for more than a decade. It's unique in every way. We know when we show up in uniform, for many, we'll represent a memory, a flashback, a reminder of the loss and sacrifice. It's not “lost” on any of us.</p>
<p>We know our mission is to provide traffic control and a uniformed presence.</p>
<p>But every year, it's much more than that.</p>
<p>As people make their way to the cemetery in cars, and some just walking, they will often stop and say, “thank you.” Others will talk to you about a lost loved one. They tell you, with pride, how he or she was so amazing. We make sure to offer a sympathetic ear and warm support.</p>

<p><strong>A Story to Tell</strong></p>
<p>All of us have a story we'll never forget.</p>
<p>It's the widow who will ask you to help her out of her car. She's clearly emotional and a bit unsteady. You take her outstretched hand and help her find the grave she's looking for. It's a slow and quiet walk. When you find the spot, it's hard to keep a dry eye. Out of respect, you slowly step away and let her spend her time privately.</p>
<p>Every one of us who serves on this mission has a story like this.</p>
<p>It's a constant reminder of how powerful this place is.</p>
<p>It's humbling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Never Forget</strong></p>
<p>Please enjoy this Memorial Day weekend. But take a moment to reflect on the loss and sacrifice so many have experienced. For the "living," the pain never really goes away. Please tell everyone, “ Never forget.”</p>
<p>As for the 2/1?</p>
<p>We stand ready to serve for decades to come.</p>
