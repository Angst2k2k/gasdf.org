As the mandatory training required for entry into the GSDF, IET emphasizes the duties, responsibilities, skills, and tasks necessary to competently perform the GSDF Mission Essential Task List (METL). IET is, by design, fast-paced and intended to immerse the recruit in a military environment. Nine citizens from across north Georgia, from Douglasville to Snellville and from Canton to Conyers, became soldiers in the GSDF. Under the watchful eye of the IET cadre, the recruits were marched in by SGT Jason Tweedell in front of guests and fellow GSDF soldiers. <a href="http://paonews.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IET_Alpha_041215_Chapman.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-370" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/import_assets/2015/04/IET_Alpha_041215_Chapman-1024x575.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="348" /></a>After flawlessly reciting the Soldier’s Creed, CPT Scott Thompson of the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) pinned each soldier with their newly earned rank as PV2 Christine Richards announced the home unit of each new soldier. <a href="http://paonews.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IET_Alpha_041215_03_Chapman.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-371" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/import_assets/2015/04/IET_Alpha_041215_03_Chapman-300x237.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="237" /></a>The GSDF’s newest soldiers were assigned to various units such as 2nd Battalion (1st Brigade), 911th Support Battalion, Judge Advocate General's (JAG) Corps, Medical Command, and the Public Affairs Office (PAO). CPT Thompson thanked the families and friends of Alpha class for their attendance and reminded them that “these soldiers will need your continued support.” CPT Thompson then instructed GSDF soldiers in attendance to “make these new soldiers feel welcome!”</p>
