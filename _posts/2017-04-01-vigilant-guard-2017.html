<p>CLAY NATIONAL GUARD CENTER, Marietta, Ga., April 1, 2017 – The Georgia State Defense Force (GSDF) recently participated in a multi-state, multi-day training exercise. Known as Vigilant Guard, this joint regional training exercise was sponsored by U.S. Northern Command, in conjunction with the National Guard Bureau. The exercise was conducted at multiple locations in Georgia at the end of March and involved numerous civilian and military participants. The exercise was designed to provide the Georgia Department of Defense (GaDoD) a realistic training scenario in order to test and improve relationships between various local, state, regional, and federal partners.</p>
