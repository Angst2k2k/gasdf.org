<p>By Sgt. Beverly Shepard and Spc. Frederick Evans</p>
<p>Georgia State Defense Force (GSDF) Soldiers placed fourth in the "Bring the Heat—Red White &amp; Boots Cook Off," a locally sponsored contest involving the armed forces, veterans, and public safety community to benefit various local community organizations.</p>

<p>In addition to winning fourth place overall, the GSDF team also placed highest among all other armed services competing in this event. Along with well-earned bragging rights, the team brought home a commemorative certificate celebrating the win.</p>
<p>"There was camaraderie and teamwork, as well as great fun," said Sgt. 1st Class Vincent Garofola, a member of the GSDF cook off team.</p>
<p>The GSDF winning cook off team members were:</p>
<p>• Command Sgt. Maj. Willie Wilkerson<br />
• Chief Warrant Officer 2 Maurice Holland<br />
• Sgt. 1st Class Vincent Garofola<br />
• Staff Sgt. Larry Ridley<br />
• Spc. David Freydkin</p>
<p>Cobb County's Marietta Daily Journal featured a front-page photo of the cook off team, as well as an inside page photo of GSDF cook off team member Sgt. 1st Class Garofola. The Real Hero Report also published photographs featuring the GSDF team and GSDF Command Sgt. Maj. Patrick O’Leary. Along with Command Sgt. Maj. O’Leary, GSDF Col. E. H. “Rusty” Hightower and GSDF Col. Edward Sonnenfeld were among others who also attended the event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A First for the GSDF</strong></p>
<p>Sponsors held the cook off on November 14, 2019—a rainy day where temperatures dipped into the 30s. But the soggy, cold weather didn't put out the flames for the GSDF team members, who smoked the competition with two barbeque chicken recipes, a "G-4 Hot Hell Sauce" and "Mom's Favorite BBQ Sauce."<br />
“It’s always a privilege to work alongside fellow service members and public safety professionals,” said Staff Sgt. Larry Ridley, leader of the GSDF team. “The cook off benefitted the community, which made it even more of a rewarding experience.”</p>
