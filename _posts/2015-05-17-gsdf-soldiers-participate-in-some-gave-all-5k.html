<p>The Some Gave All 5K is dedicated to Maj. Kevin Jenrette who died on June 4, 2009 near Kakar, Afghanistan. Maj. Jenrette was from Lula, Georgia and was a member of the Georgia Army National Guard 1st Battalion, 108th Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition Squadron, 48th Infantry Brigade Combat Team. The date of the race is significant to the family of Maj. Jenrette because he graduated from U.S. Army Ranger school on May 10, 1996. Organizers of the event plan to continue holding the race annually on the second Saturday in May. All proceeds from the race are donated to the Georgia National Guard Family Support Foundation. The Some Gave All 5K has raised over $100,000 in the past five years for the Georgia National Guard Family Support Foundation. The Georgia National Guard Family Support Foundation is a non-profit corporation established to provide assistance during times of financial crisis to the members and families of the Georgia National Guard, federal/state civilian employees of the Georgia Department of Defense and other qualified military members in Georgia. GSDF soldiers give back to the people of Georgia in a variety of ways. Whether on a search and rescue mission, providing aid to stranded motorists, or supporting a 5K race, GSDF soldiers are always ready to serve the people of Georgia.</p>
