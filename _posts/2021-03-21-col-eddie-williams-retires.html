<p><strong>U.S. Army Veteran Served 16 years in the Georgia State Defense Force</strong></p>
<p>By 2nd Lt. Beverly Shepard</p>
<p>After 16 years of service to the Georgia State Defense Force (GSDF), Col. Eddie Williams recently retired amid a showering of awards, gifts, and accolades.</p>
<p>Col. Williams, a West Point graduate and U.S. Army veteran, has a military career spanning 30 years. His service in the GSDF involved various roles: Recruiting Officer, Public Affairs Office Chief, Commander of Operations Company, Executive Officer, then Commander of the 911th Support Battalion, and most recently, Commander of the 76th Support Brigade.</p>
<p>“He was a true leader,” said Lt. Col. Ismael Rodriguez, Acting Commander of the 76th Support Brigade, who, in quoting U.S. Army General Douglas McArthur, added of Col. Williams, “He had the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others.”</p>

<p>Col. Williams bid farewell to the GSDF headquarters staff in Marietta Ga. and to the 76th Support Brigade troops at their headquarters on the Kennesaw State University–Marietta campus. His retirement ceremony comments included reciting a quote from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.:</p>
<p>“Everyone can be great because everyone can serve. You don’t have to have a college degree to serve. You don’t have to make your subject and your verb agree to serve. You don’t have to know about Plato and Aristotle to serve. You don’t have to know Einstein’s Theory of Relativity to serve. You only need a heart full of grace, a soul generated by love. And you can be that servant.”</p>
<p>For his retirement, the GSDF presented Col. Williams a Legion of Merit medal. The Legion of Merit medal was authorized by Congress in 1942. It is awarded to those in key positions of responsibility and power for their service and achievements.</p>
<p>The 76th Support Brigade’s Officers, NCOs, and troops presented him an officer’s saber, a framed brigade guidon, a plaque of appreciation, and other gifts and mementos.</p>
<p>“I’m definitely going to miss him,” said Command Sgt. Maj. Jeff Ulmer, who has been in the 76th Support Brigade since the unit’s inception approximately a decade ago. “It was probably one of the best relationships with a commander that a command sergeant major could ever have.”</p>
<p>Col. Williams was born in Nurnberg, Germany while his father, a U.S. Army noncomissioned officer, was stationed there. During his service in the U.S. Army, Col. Williams was an Airborne, Ranger, and Green Beret. In the Army, he earned numerous military awards and skill badges, including the Ranger tab, Special Forces tab, Jump Master wings, Pathfinder badge, and numerous U.S. Army ribbons.</p>

Service On and Off the Field</strong></p>
<p>In 2015, Col. Williams was among those Soldiers then Georgia National Guard Command Sgt. Maj. Phillip A. Stringfield, recognized for their assistance and dedication to Star Behavioral Health Providers, a program established to educate clinicians so they could help support military service members and families before, during, and post deployment. These Soldiers volunteered their time to conduct numerous full-day detailed presentations on U.S. military culture and deployment cycles to Georgia-based therapists, clinicians, counselors, and psychologists.</p>

<p>Col. Williams was dedicated to promoting the GSDF message. His many appearances included those before the Rotary Club, and other community organizations throughout his career.</p>
<p>During his service, Col. Williams frequently greeted new GSDF recruits during military intake processing. He would commit the name of a private to memory after only one introduction. Those who know him say that his military presence commanded attention, while his personality brought warmth and laughter to a room.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After GSDF Retirement</strong></span></p>
<p>After his GSDF retirement, Col. Williams plans to continue pursuing his professional vocations, running his own company as a leadership and management trainer, and working with a local information technology company with clients nationwide.</p>
<p>“Old Soldiers never die. They just fade away,” Col. Williams said in parting, quoting from U.S. Army General Douglas McArthur, also a West Point alumnus. “I now close my military career as a Soldier who tried to do his duty as God gave me the light to see that duty.”</p>
