<p>Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) conducts the course which provides intermediate level education for officers to support the missions and goals of the GSDF. The curriculum includes instruction on leadership philosophy, planning, and military decision-making processes. The course is a combination of residency and virtual training.</p>
<p>“They represent the best the GSDF has to offer,” Lt. Col. Allen Vance, Deputy Commander, TRADOC, said during the graduation ceremony. “I couldn’t be more proud or more pleased to work with them.”</p>
<p>The intensive CSC training involved the following courses:<br />
◾History, Mission, and Organization of the GSDF<br />
◾Operations, Training, and Leadership at Battalion and Brigade Levels<br />
◾Multi-Agency Incident Command<br />
◾Force Management, including Soldier Recruiting, Retention, Development, Discipline, and Assignment</p>
<p>Graduates also received a research project. The project was based on the Barnesville, Georgia tornado of 2011 and included the GSDF response mission.<br />
GSDF Commander Brig. Gen. Thomas Danielson attended the ceremony. Gen. Danielson commended graduates for successfully completing the course, and remarked, “It was an honor to attend the ceremony.”</p>
<p>Family and friends also attended, as did other members of the GSDF.</p>
