<p>FORT BENNING, Ga., April 01, 2017 -Â While participating in a recent opposing force (OPFOR) mission at Fort Benning, Georgia, Georgia State Defense Force (GSDF) members voluntarily helped extinguish a small fire in the Infantry Training Area. Nearby GSDF members saw the fire ignite during active OPFOR operations and immediately responded. Utilizing personal tools, vehicles, and various resources, GSDF personnel were able to extinguish the fire and prevent it from spreading. The fire was caused by a flare.</p>

<p>Even though the flames had already begun to spread, GSDF personnel were able to contain and then smother the fire before it was able to spread to other training areas. The Georgia Army National Guard (GAARNG) expressed their gratitude to the GSDF, citing that without their immediate response, the entire training area would have been shut down by range control and the training mission would have been compromised. After the area was cleared by the GAARNG, GSDF Soldiers continued with the physically demanding OPFOR mission.</p>
