<p>One of the newest members of the Georgia State Defense Force (GSDF) is no stranger to serving his state and country. In addition to his participation in the GSDF, Capt. Judson Hill is an elected official, serving his community in the Georgia State Senate.</p>
<p>Capt. Hill is assigned to the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate, GSDF (SJA). He will serve as a staff judge advocate, supporting the Georgia National Guard JAG and assisting GSDF members with both civilian and military legal situations, from wills, estates, and landlord/tenant issues to military justice issues.</p>
<p>Capt. Hill graduated from Emory University with a bachelor's in Economics and Political Science. His juris doctorate degree is from the Walter F. George School of Law at Mercer University. He served in the Reagan Administration as an Assistant United States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, and also in Washington, D.C. as a White House appointee at the United States Department of State, Agency for International Development.</p>
<p>He was first elected to the Georgia Senate in 2004, representing East Cobb County and a portion of Sandy Springs in Fulton County. He currently serves as Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. He is also a member of the Appropriations, Health and Human Services and Rules committees. As a State Senator, Hill has been an active supporter of the Georgia State Defense Force, sponsoring several pieces of legislation, during the last few years, that benefited GSDF soldiers.</p>
<p>"The Georgia State Defense Force provides a tremendous benefit to the people of our state," Capt. Hill said during his initial entry training (IET) graduation. "To better serve and support them (the GSDF), I wanted to become one of them."</p>

<p>He also has been active in state military issues, from locating commissary services near Clay National Guard Center and Dobbins Air Reserve Base to participating in the Cobb Chamber of Commerce Honorary Commanders program. He and his legislative colleagues continue to address the ongoing Defense Base Closure and Realignment (BRAC) Commission activities that affect Georgia.</p>
<p>When looking to the future of the GSDF from his unique perspective, he said, "Georgians are honored by the level of professionalism of the GSDF personnel. It is important for the GSDF to continue to grow in size, in order to enhance its ability to support and help our National Guard to pursue their mission."</p>
<p>Capt. Hill and his wife, Shelly, who are proud parents of three children, have lived in East Cobb County for more than 25 years. Shelly is a graduate of Lassiter High School and a lifelong resident of East Cobb. He and his wife have been active in the East Cobb community for many years, including membership at Johnson Ferry Baptist Church, working with Young Life, serving on the Board of East Cobb Park, and volunteering in many community service activities. Aside from his service to the state and community, Capt. Hill has been a Sunday school and Bible study teacher for many years. He is currently a partner in a telecommunication services firm.</p>
