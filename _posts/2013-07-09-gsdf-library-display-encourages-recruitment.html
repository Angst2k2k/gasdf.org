<p>The Georgia State Defense Force’s Third Battalion, First Brigade, has an area of operation that encompasses 17 counties in northeast Georgia. Amongst these is Oglethorpe County, just east of Athens. Oglethorpe County is made up of about 28 square miles and has roughly 15,000 residents. In emergency situations, the county relies mostly on volunteer services, such as First Responders and its Fire Departments.</p>
<p>This display, which includes two cases, spotlights the Mission Essential Task List (METL) of the GSDF: Search and Rescue Operations, Medical Support, Disaster Reconnaissance, National Guard Family Assistance Support, and Traffic/Evacuation Control. Each item of the METL is accompanied by photos and accoutrement illustrating that particular goal.<a href="http://paonews.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/DSCN8031-11-08-412_Chapman.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-209" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/import_assets/2013/07/DSCN8031-11-08-412_Chapman-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>In addition to the photos and props, there is a history outline of the GSDF and a “Who Can Join” summary displayed. Take-away information is included, which entails the goals and mission of the GSDF, as well as recruitment contact information.</p>
<p>The display will remain at the library throughout the month of July 2013 at 858 Athens Road (HWY 78) Lexington, Georgia 30648.</p>
