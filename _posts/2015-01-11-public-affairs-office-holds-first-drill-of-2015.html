<p>CLAY NATIONAL GUARD CENTER, Marietta, Georgia, January 10, 2015, By PV2 Michael Chapman - The Public Affairs Office (PAO) of the Georgia State Defense Force (GSDF) held its first drill of 2015 on Saturday, January 10. <a href="http://paonews.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/PAO-team-first-Drill-2015_640_Chapman.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-317" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/import_assets/2015/01/PAO-team-first-Drill-2015_640_Chapman-300x214.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="214" /></a>2LT Allan Hayes instructed PV2 Michael Chapman and PV2 Alexander Davidson on the mission and role of the unit. PAO fulfills the GSDF's obligation to keep the people of Georgia informed. PAO also helps to establish and maintain confidence in the GSDF and its ability to conduct operations in the state. Drills such as these allow GSDF soldiers to learn new skills and hone their knowledge in order to stay “Ready to Serve.”<br />
