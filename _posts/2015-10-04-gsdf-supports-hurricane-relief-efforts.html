<p>GSDF Soldiers, working alongside Georgia Army National Guard (GAARNG) Soldiers, filled 8,000 sandbags and loaded them onto eight flatbed trailers. The sandbags will be used to create a water buffer to control flooding in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Over 100 GSDF and GAARNG Soldiers supported the relief activities.</p>
