<p>CLAY NATIONAL GUARD CENTER, Marietta, Ga. — The Georgia State Defense Force (GSDF) recently completed its 2016-01 Soldier Leadership Course (SLC), marking an impressive milestone in the military careers of the 12 class graduates.</p>
<p>Leadership and training are essential to the GSDF, and the SLC provides Soldiers an opportunity to acquire the technical and tactical skills, knowledge, and <span style="line-height: 1.6;">experience needed to lead others.</span></p>
<p>The graduation, which took place in June at the Georgia Public Safety Training Center (GPSTC) in Forsyth, recognized the completion of the arduous six-month class that began in January. “We’re proud of this year’s class and its achievements,” said Lt. Col. Vance, Deputy Commander, Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC). “These graduates represent some of GSDF’s very best.”</p>
<p><strong>SLC Areas of Focus</strong></p>
<p>The SLC focused on three areas: Leadership, Training, and Situational Training Exercises. Throughout the course, Soldiers gained opportunities to hone their skills in various disciplines, including land navigation, medical triage, and tactical operations. Soldiers applying to the SLC must receive approval from their chain of command. In addition, class candidates must meet all GSDF requirements and regulations, including height/weight standards, current CPR certification, and current Anti-Terrorism-Level One certification.</p>

<p><strong>TRADOC’s Course Development</strong></p>
<p>TRADOC administered the 2016-01 SLC. Sgt. 1st Class Derucki and Staff Sgt. Slocumb, both of TRADOC, led the Cadre team. The Cadre spent a year revamping the SLC, and the revised course was offered for the first time to this class. “The work Cadre poured into developing the course is evidenced by its outstanding delivery to this class of graduates,” Lt. Col. Vance said. “It’s a testament of the Cadre’s dedication to TRADOC and to the standards GSDF upholds.”</p>
