<p>Along with the promotions, several awards were also presented. Brig. Gen. Danielson presented the Meritorious Service Medal to Capt. Clark Howard. The medal was awarded to Capt. Howard for sustained performance of outstanding service in a position of responsibility and trust. Capt. Howard joined the GSDF after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and has been a dedicated member. Throughout his many years in the GSDF, Capt. Howard has performed his duties in an outstanding manner, which has clearly aided the GSDF in furthering its mission.</p>

<p>In addition, members of the GSDF Public Affairs Branch were recognized for their participation in Vigilant Guard 2017 last spring. Vigilant Guard 2017 was a joint regional training exercise sponsored by U.S. Northern Command in conjunction with the National Guard Bureau. The exercise provided the National Guard with an opportunity to improve cooperation and relationships with local, state, regional civilian, military, and federal partners in preparation for emergencies and catastrophic events. The GSDF Public Affairs Branch worked closely with the Georgia Department of Defense Office of Public Affairs to tell the story of Vigilant Guard and the Georgia National Guard. In recognition for the outstanding work, these GSDF members each received an Achievement Medal from Brig. Gen. Danielson. In addition, Capt. Charles Emmons, commander of the Georgia National Guard 124th Mobile Public Affairs Detachment, presented certificates of appreciation to each member of the GSDF Public Affairs Branch.</p>
