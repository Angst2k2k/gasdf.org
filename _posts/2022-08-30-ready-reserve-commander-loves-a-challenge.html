<p><strong>PAO:</strong> What is Ready Reserve?</p>
<p><strong>Lt. Col. Rodriguez:</strong> Soldiers in the Ready Reserve are unable to maintain full-time active status for various reasons. However, they can be available during emergency call-ups. Ready Reserve also provides entry in the GSDF for prior military service applicants with valuable skills, who possess rank for which there is no available GSDF Table of Allowance Vacancy.</p>
<p><strong>PAO:</strong> How do Ready Reserve Soldiers serve the GSDF?</p>
<p><strong>Lt. Col. Rodriguez:</strong> The Ready Reserve promotes the best interests of the GSDF in that the Ready Reserve allows for retention, in an organized structure, of trained and skilled Soldiers.</p>
<p><strong> PAO:</strong> What is your vision for Ready Reserve?</p>
<p><strong>Lt. Col. Rodriguez:</strong> As Commander of Ready Reserve, my vision is to establish teamwork. With healthy teamwork comes confidence in the personnel who form the unit. I believe that being an officer/noncommissioned officer assigned in any capacity to work with troops is a privilege. One should accept that responsibility with a determination to succeed.</p>

<p><strong>PAO:</strong> When did you join the GSDF?</p>
<p><strong>Lt. Col. Rodriguez:</strong> I joined the GSDF in February 2011.</p>
<p><strong>PAO:</strong> Where in the GSDF did you serve prior to Ready Reserve?</p>
<p><strong>Lt. Col. Rodriguez:</strong> I previously served in the 76th Support Brigade.</p>
<p><strong>PAO:</strong> Is there anything else you would like to add?</p>
<p><strong>Lt. Col. Rodriguez:</strong> This Command will be challenging, but I love a challenge!</p>
