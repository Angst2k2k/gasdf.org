<p>BLANKETS CREEK PARK, Canton, Georgia, March 28, 2015, By PV2 Michael Chapman – Members of the Georgia State Defense Force (GSDF) were recently called upon to support the 2nd Annual Georgia National Guard Family Support Foundation Half Marathon and Ruck Run.</p>

<p>The event was held at Blankets Creek Park in Cherokee County on Saturday, March 28, 2015. The GSDF was on-site to support the Georgia Army National Guard (GAANG) Public Affairs Office and the Recruiting and Retention Unit. Two GSDF soldiers also took part in the Ruck Run. WO1 Daniel Mayer and PFC Todd O’Neil, both of the G3 Operations Staff, participated in the run. Proceeds from the event will benefit the Georgia National Guard Family Support Foundation. The foundation, established in 1994, is a non-profit corporation which provides emergency financial assistance to members and families of the Georgia National Guard, federal or state civilian employees of the Georgia Department of Defense, and other qualified military members in Georgia during times of crisis. Events such as this highlight the close working relationship between the GAANG and GSDF as well as the GSDF’s ongoing commitment to the people of Georgia.</p>
