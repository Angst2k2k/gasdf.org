<p>This clinic was the first ever held by the Georgia Army National Guard. The goal of this clinic was to provide a venue for Georgia Guard personnel to improve their marksmanship skills.</p>
<p>For eight days, instructors led by Sgt. 1st Class Jakob Raven (GAARNG) of the Georgia Garrison Training Center (GGTC) worked to improve Soldier‘s basic marksmanship skills across a wide array of weapons and techniques. These ranged from pistols, rifles, shotguns to crew-served weapons.</p>
