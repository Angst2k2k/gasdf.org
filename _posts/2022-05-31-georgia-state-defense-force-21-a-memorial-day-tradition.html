<p>This weekend, an army of volunteers made their way to the national cemeteries. Armed with American flags and a heart full of compassion, they made hallowed ground come to life. For two decades, the 2nd battalion 1st brigade ("the 2/1") has offered security and support. Shaped up and squared away—this is our holy mission. As commander, I know we represent today's military. We take the task seriously and feel privileged to honor all those who came before us.</p>

<p>This year felt different. We noticed more family, friends, and battle buddies were younger.</p>
<p>Every generation can point to a war or conflict that helped define them. For today's younger generation, it's Iraq and Afghanistan. Our battalion watched year after year as the cemetery at Canton made room for the post-9/11 fallen heroes. You can see the pain fresh in a widow's eyes as she wipes back tears. When she sees us in uniform, it reminds her of the picture on her phone shot in a hangar just before he deployed. He was strong, fearless, and it was the last time she would see him alive. Her pain is the same as generations of widows who came before her. Only hers still feels new and present.</p>
<p>We also witnessed fathers of all ages bringing their sons and daughters to help them better understand the true meaning of sacrifice. We watched with admiration and respect as a veteran taught his son how to properly salute and then read a grave marker aloud. It always leaves you with a lump in your throat. It's always humbling.</p>
<p>The Soldiers of the 2/1 leave you this Memorial Day with one request: As we all look for ways to spend more time outdoors, take a minute, mark your calendars, and make a commitment to visit a national cemetery near you. Bring the whole family, leave your phone in your pocket, and be prepared to sit and take in the silence. If you want to honor all these fallen heroes—read, remember, and never forget.</p>
