<p>CLAY NATIONAL GUARD CENTER, Marietta, February 6, 2016 – The Georgia State Defense Force (GSDF) recently received a National Guard-themed rug—sent from a Georgia state representative to Brig. Gen. Thomas Danielson to recognize the GSDF commander and members of the GSDF for their service. The gift came on the heels of National Guard Day at the Capitol. Representative John P. Yates (District 73 – Griffin) introduced a resolution in the Georgia General Assembly, recognizing January 25, 2016 as National Guard Day at the Capitol. Gov. Nathan Deal signed a National Guard Day at the Capitol proclamation that commended “the men and women of the Georgia National Guard for their strength, leadership, and courage in their willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves.” The GSDF was included in the proclamation. Gov. Deal was on hand for the recognition, as were members of the GSDF. Members of the Georgia Army National Guard and the Georgia Air National Guard, as well as cadets of the Youth Challenge Program, were present also.
