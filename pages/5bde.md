**5BDE Mission Statement**:

  *The mission of 5BDE, GSDF is to provide mission-ready military forces to assist state and local authorities in times of state emergencies (man-made, natural disasters, pandemic), to conduct homeland security and community service activities under the umbrella of Defense Support to Civil Authorities, and to augment the Georgia Army and Air National Guard as required*.

Georgia State Defense Force's 5th Brigade (5BDE) was the first to have a fully embedded unit with the Georgia Army National Guard (GAARNG) over 10 years ago and has been leading the way ever since.


Designated "Vikings" in late 2020, 5BDE prides itself on attacking challenges and finding innovative ways to solve problems (just like the Northmen of old). 5BDE has earned a solid reputation across the state and is now requested by numerous GAARNG units looking for an exceptional training partner that gets the job done whatever may come.


The Vikings also lead the way in response to natural disasters. 5BDE maintains high training standards for all elements of the [Mission Essential Task List (METL)](/pages/about.md/#basic-mission-essential-task-list-bmetl) and works hard to ensure that the right gear is in the right place when mother nature throws a tantrum. The troops have reponded in times of need after hurricanes, tornados, icy roads and river floods. They strive to be the first boots on the ground setting up the most effective response possible.


The 5th brigade is made up of volunteers coming from a variety of backgrounds including law enforcement, electricians, IT professionals, engineers, truck drivers, chemists and educators. No matter what your background, there's a place to use your professional knowledge blended with new skills to serve the citizens of Georgia in their greatest times of need.

While all GSDF units can operate anywhere in Georgia, the Vikings Area of Responsibility (AOR) covers a very large portion of the state. Drawing a loop including Carrollton, Lagrange, Columbus, Cordele, Hinesville and Augusta just about encompass the entire area. With such a large geographic span to cover we have more than one drill station to work with. Our primary drill stations are shown below.

All 5th Brigade units support Direct Support of Civilian Authorities (DSCA), Community Engagement (COMENG), and Military to Military Support (MTMS).
5th Brigade leads the way in MTMS. The missions we undertake are highly varied and offer a challenging array of engagement. This provides opportunities for soldiers at all levels to develop skills, build relationships and contribute in a meaningful way to the citizens of Georgia when they need help most. Some examples of MTMS missions include:


 - Pre-mobilization Training and Assistance Element (PTAE) means helping troops identify areas of improvement as a starting point for advanced deployment training.
 - Small Arms Leaders Course (SALC) allows soldiers to support National Guard units as they advance their skills on live-fire ranges.
 - Andrew Sullens Marksmanship Competition lets soldiers engage in range support and includes a chance to compete if selected for the GSDF Competitive Marksmanship Team (CMT).
 - 1/54th Security Forces Assistance Brigade (SFAB) missions provide in-depth training in traditional combat tactics and small unit tactics. This enables SFAB advisors to hone their skills before deployment to assist in training our allies in developing nations.

DSCA and COMENG are also significant parts of 5th Brigadeâ€™s mission set. In addition to cooperating with multiple Emergency Management Agencies (EMAs) we work with numerous government agencies and non-government organizations (NGOs). Some recent examples include:

  - Points of Distribution (PODs) operation
  - Food Bank relief box packing
  - Hurricane evacuation shelter support
  - Urban and Wilderness Search and Rescue (USAR / WSAR)
  - COVID-19 related missions embedded with National Guard units.
