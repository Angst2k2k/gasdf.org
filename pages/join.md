While there are minimum requirements to join the GSDF, it is recommended to speak with a recruiter even if you think you may not be eligible. Often candidates who assume they are ineligible are eligible. 
</div>

## CANDIDATE REQUIREMENTS

All GSDF recruits are required to undergo a background check. This information will be kept confidential. All applications will be handled on an individual basis. While certain convictions do not bar entry, it will be very important to be honest when filling out the security packet as falsification of information will be grounds for dismissal.

All members of the GSDF are required to posses a high school diploma or equivalent, are between the ages of 18 and 64, a US Citizen or Legal Resident. Due to the cost of training and processing time of new personnel, the GSDF requires a minimum two (2) years commitment to serve.

The GSDF will prohibit any form of discrimination based on race, religion, national origin or gender in conduct of the activities of the command. The GSDF will provide an equal opportunity for advancement or selection to position. The GSDF policy on sexual harassment is clear and unequivocal. All GSDF members are entitled to serve in an environment free from any form of sexual harassment.

All personnel will be evaluated by the medical staff to determine their eligibility to serve in the GSDF.



## HEIGHT AND WEIGHT STANDARDS

(GSDF Soldier’s Handbook: “Appendix B”)

1. The maintenance of appropriate height and weight standards is important not only to general health but to ensure safe performance of GSDF duties and acceptable appearance in uniform.

2. The height and weight table below prescribes maximum allowable weight for GSDF personnel based on height. Measurements will be taken without shoes. Height will be rounded to the nearest inch. Three pounds credit may be given for regular street clothing.

3. Personnel who do not meet these standards are strongly encouraged to contact their personal physician who can make recommendations regarding diet and exercise programs to bring weight into acceptable and healthful limits. The GSDF Surgeon and GSDF medical personnel are also available to provide dietary and exercise advice.

4. Personnel who do not meet the standards prescribed in the accompanying table may not be allowed to wear the Class A, B, or dress uniforms. Brigade Commanders have the latitude to determine if personnel exceeding the standards present an acceptable appearance in these uniforms.

5. The standards contained here exceed those allowed for active/reserve component personnel and take into account the nature of GSDF duties. They are designed to ensure that GSDF personnel present minimum acceptable appearance when in uniform.
