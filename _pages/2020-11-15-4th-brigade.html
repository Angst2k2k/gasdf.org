<p>4<sup>th</sup> Brigade is Headquartered in <strong><em>Ashburn, Georgia. </em></strong>Our Area of Operation covers all South Georgia from the Alabama Line to the Coast and from Crisp County to Florida.</p>
<p>Over the past decade the soldiers of 4BDE have responded to natural disasters such as Hurricane Mathew, Hurricane Irma Hurricane Michael as well as the 2017 Tornado outbreak.</p>
<p>With the recent response to the Covid-19 pandemic, 4BDE spent 6 weeks packing meals to distribute for families in need. We also worked 7 different PODs to distribute these meals to feed 10,000 families.</p>
