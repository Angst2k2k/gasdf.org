<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><strong>The 76<sup>th</sup> Support Brigade provides troop and resource support for the entire GA State Defense Force (GSDF), as well as to the GA Army and Air National Guard (GAARNG), the Georgia Public Health Department (GPH), the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS), American Red Cross, and several other state agencies.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within the brigade are the following units:</p>
<p><strong>Headquarters and Headquarters Company</strong> (76th Spt BDE HHC) - the administrative HQ for our personnel.</p>
<p><strong>The 911<sup>th</sup> Support Battalion</strong> provides support to the GSDF and the GA Army National Guard’s 78<sup>th</sup> Aviation Troop Command. Within the 911<sup>th</sup> are a Force Protection Company and a Operation Company. Operations Company works directly with 78<sup>th</sup> ATC on mission preparedness, equipment inventory, and other critical functions. Force Protection Company provides security, traffic control, and other support roles during local and state-wide missions, activities, and exercises, to include verifying access on all incoming personnel to ensure authorization, over-watch responsibilities for entry gates, vehicle searches for unauthorized materials and static security for facilities.</p>
<p><strong>The 132<sup>nd</sup> Medical Battalio</strong>n provides critical medical support to the GSDF, GAARNG, and other state agencies. These include conducting medical assessments prior to deployment, conducting Point-of-Dispensing (POD) operations to assist in providing critical medical resources to the local community following a natural disaster, and providing medical skills during search-and-rescue missions. Strong relationships developed with the GA Army Guard MEDCOM, GA Public Health, and Cobb-Douglas Public Health, allow the 132<sup>nd</sup> to provide both exercise and “real world” support. For example, 132<sup>nd</sup> Med Bn was an essential part of a multi-agency response, when recently tasked by the GA Department of Defense and FEMA to help evacuees from the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, flown to Dobbins ARB for critical medical care and relief following Hurricane Maria.</p>
<p><strong>The 1<sup>st</sup> Engineer Battalion</strong> provides vital engineering, assessment, structural evaluation, infrastructure analysis, and support to the GSDF and the GA Department of Defense (GADoD). Troops both train and work closely with the GA Emergency Management Agencies (GEMA).</p>
<p>Additionally, the 76<sup>th</sup> Support Brigade hosts the GSDF Funeral Honor Guard, which conducts needed services to honor our fallen. Additionally, we host a Color Guard team which assists numerous Federal, State, and Civilian organizations during ceremonies, holidays, and events.</p>
