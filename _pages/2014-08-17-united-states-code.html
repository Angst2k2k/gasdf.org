<p align="justify"><strong>§ Section 109. Maintenance of other troops</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>(a)</strong> In time of peace, a State or Territory,<br />
Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or the District of Columbia may<br />
maintain no troops other than those of its National Guard and defense<br />
forces authorized by subsection (c).</p>
<p><strong>(b)</strong> Nothing in this title limits the right of a State or<br />
Territory, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or the District of Columbia<br />
to use its National Guard or its defense forces authorized by subsection<br />
(c) within its borders in time of peace, or prevents it from organizing<br />
and maintaining police or constabulary.</p>
<p><strong>(c)</strong> In addition to its National Guard, if any, a State or<br />
Territory, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or the District of Columbia<br />
may, as provided by its laws, organize and maintain defense forces. A<br />
defense force established under this section may be used within the<br />
jurisdiction concerned, as its chief executive (or commanding general in<br />
the case of the District of Columbia) considers necessary, but it may<br />
not be called, ordered, or drafted into the armed forces.</p>
<p><strong>(d)</strong> A member of a defense force established under subsection (c)<br />
is not, because of that membership, exempt from service in the armed<br />
forces, nor is he entitled to pay, allowances, subsistence,<br />
transportation, or medical care or treatment, from funds of the United<br />
States.</p>
<p><strong>(e)</strong> A person may not become a member of a defense force<br />
established under subsection (c) if he is a member of a reserve<br />
component of the armed forces.</p>
