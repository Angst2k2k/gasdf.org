<p><strong>The Georgia State Defense Force (GSDF) is a component of the Georgia Department of Defense (DoD), along with the Georgia Air National Guard and the Georgia Army National Guard. The GSDF serves under the direction of Georgia’s Governor and Adjutant General to provide disciplined, professionally trained Soldiers for rapid response in assisting Georgia communities during emergencies.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The GSDF’s volunteer units serve on a variety of mission types, including domestic operations and community engagement. The GSDF also provides support and training for military units of the United States and the Georgia DoD.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The GSDF provided COVID-19 support to the state of Georgia from March 16, 2020 through July 17, 2020. This was the longest continuous call-up in the organization’s history. The Georgia DoD presented a Georgia Distinguished Ribbon to the GSDF for its service during the COVID-19 pandemic.</strong></p>
