<p>I am a volunteer. I am a Soldier.<br />
I stand for the citizens of Georgia.<br />
From the majestic mountains of the north to the city of Atlanta; from the rolling plains of the south to the splendor of the sea- where I am needed is where I will be found.<br />
I am a well-trained and professional member of Georgiaâ€™s proud military tradition.<br />
I will follow the orders of my superiors with conviction and lead those in my charge with distinction.<br />
I will never fail my unit, my state or my Governor.<br />
Where there is despair, I will bring hope.<br />
Where there is need, I will bring sustenance. Where is fear, I will bring resolve.<br />
As a sentry on watch for my Great State, I will be ever vigilant and steadfast. I am capable, courageous and confident in my ability to defend the Constitution of the State of Georgia and the United States of America.<br />
The citizen of Georgia can sleep peacefully, for I am ready, reliable and will respond rapidly when called.<br />
I am a proud member of the Georgia State Defense Force.<br />
I am Ready to Serve.</p>
