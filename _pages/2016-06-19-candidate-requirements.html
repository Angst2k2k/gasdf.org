<p>All GSDF recruits are required to undergo a background check. This information will be kept confidential. All applications will be handled on an individual basis. While certain convictions do not bar entry, it will be very important to be honest when filling out the security packet as falsification of information will be grounds for dismissal.</p>
<p>All members of the GSDF must possess a high school diploma or equivalent, <em>i.e</em>., GED.</p>
<p>Members must be between the ages of 18 and 64, with the following exceptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>17-year-olds may join with written parental permission.</li>
<li>65-and-above-year-olds may join under an age waiver – please discuss with your recruiting contact.</li>
</ol>
<p>Members must be US Citizens or Legal Residents.</p>
<p>Due to the cost of training and processing time of new members, the GSDF requires a minimum two (2) years commitment to serve.</p>
<p>The GSDF will prohibit any form of discrimination based on race, religion, national origin or gender in conduct of the activities of the command. The GSDF will provide an equal opportunity for advancement or selection to position. The GSDF policy on sexual harassment is clear and unequivocal.
